# Example Alembic Project

This project demonstrates a minimal setup of SQLAlchemy 2.0 with Alembic migrations and SQLite.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (async/modern API)
- ✅ Alembic for database schema migrations
- ✅ SQLite as a simple local database
- ✅ Poetry for dependency and environment management

## 📂 Project Structure

- `models.py` — defines ORM models.
- `db.py` — sets up the database engine and session.
- `main.py` — main entry point (could be CLI, test runner, etc).
- `migrations/` — Alembic migration scripts.
- `data/` — holds the SQLite database file (empty except for `.gitkeep`).

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
poetry install
